# Optimization-and-Gradient-Descent-in-California-Housing-Price-Analysis
I comprehensively explored optimization techniques and regression analysis. The focal point was the California Housing Price Data Set, comprising 20640 instances with 9 attributes
By working on this project, I achieved proficiency in:
- Applying optimization algorithms to enhance solutions.
- Grasping the underlying principles of ordinary least squares (OLS) and implementing gradient descent for best-fit determination.
- I am loading, examining, and processing data for meaningful insights. We are constructing and understanding cost functions for model evaluation.
- Exploring diverse gradient descent variations for improved convergence
Through this hands-on experience, I honed my optimization, regression, and data preprocessing skills, reinforcing my grasp of key machine-learning concepts.
